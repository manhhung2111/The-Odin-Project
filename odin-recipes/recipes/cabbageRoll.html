        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Bring a large stock pot of water to boil. Add the whole head of
            cabbage and boil for 5 minutes. Remove to a colander to drain and
            cool. Once cooled cut 1/2 inch off the stem end of the cabbage.
            Carefully remove 12 leaves and cut the tough rib out of the stem end
            in the shape of a V.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a large skillet heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion
            and cook for 2-3 minutes; stirring several times. Reduce heat to low
            and add garlic. Cook for 1 minute stirring constantly. Add the
            tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, cider vinegar, and brown sugar. Season
            with salt and pepper to taste. Simmer for 10 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spoon a thin layer of the tomato sauce into a 9 x 13-inch casserole
            dish. In a large bowl mix the ground pork sausage, ground beef,
            onion, garlic, egg, rice, parsley, and paprika. Place about 1/3 cup
            of the meat mixture in the center of the cabbage roll. Bring in the
            sides and roll tight. Place on the tomato sauce in the casserole
            dish. Repeat until all the cabbage rolls are made and in the
            casserole dish. Top with remaining tomato sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cover with aluminum foil. Bake in a preheated 350-degree oven for
            80-90 minutes
